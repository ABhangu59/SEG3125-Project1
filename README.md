# STYLE BLVD (Project 1 for SEG 3125 by Ali Bhangu)

STYLE BLVD is a website for a modern hair salon in Ottawa that offers a variety of hair services, including haircuts, styling, coloring, and more.

The goal of the project is to understand and apply User-Centered Design (UCD) principles to create an intuitive and aesthetically pleasing booking website for a hair salon.

Tech Stack:
Built with HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and JavaScript.

Notes:
JavaScript is used extensively for the multi-step booking process and dynamic interactions, although it may not appear on the GitHub language breakdown.
JavaScript files can be found under the `javascript` folder, specifically handling the booking steps and form validations.
The location provided on the website is not a real salon location in Ottawa, it serves as inspiration for the business and design.

The `index.html` in the root folder is intended for GitHub Pages deployment, while other essential HTML files, including booking steps, are located in the `html` folder.
